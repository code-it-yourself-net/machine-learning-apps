## MNIST

The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 20,000 examples (mnist/mnist_train_small.csv), and a test set of 10,000 examples (mnist/mnist_test.csv). It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
